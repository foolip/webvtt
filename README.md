WebVTT
======

This is the source of the [WebVTT specification](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/).

Contributions can be made via the [W3C Text Tracks Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/texttracks/).

You can use the specification itself for filing bugs or go directly to the [W3C bug tracker](http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=TextTracks%20CG&component=WebVTT).

A commit hook ascertains that commits to the master branch get automatically sync-ed to the CVS repository at the W3C and thus update the spec.
